        <em>Autoreview</em> is a framework for building and evaluating systems
        to automatically select relevant publications for literature reviews,
        starting from small sets of seed papers. These automated methods have
        the potential to help researchers save time and effort when keeping up
        with relevant literature, as well as surfacing papers that more manual
        methods may miss. I show that this approach can work to recommend
        relevant literature, and can also be used to systematically compare
        different features used in the recommendations.

        Scientific silos can hinder innovation. These information "filter
        bubbles" and the growing challenge of information overload limit
        awareness across the literature, making it difficult to keep track of
        even narrow areas of interest, let alone discover new ones.
        SciSight/Bridger is a project focused on facilitating discovery of
        scholars and their work, by locating commonalities and contrasts between
        scientists.

        The scholarly literature is a vast store of formalized human knowledge,
        interconnected by citations between publications. Looking at these

        We analyze the mathematical language used in hundreds of thousands of
        scientific papers, comparing the use of math across different
        disciplines. By comparing the distributions of mathematical symbols and
        terms across fields, we quantify the "jargon barriers" between these
        fieldsâ€”the difficulty any two fileds might have communicating based on
        how different their use of mathematical language is. We find that
        characterizing fields by their use of mathematical language causes them
        to group in intuitive ways, and we explore how this approach could be
        used for recommendations in the scholarly literature, and for helping to
        bridge knowledge gaps in science.
